- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ai6aj
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in radio (whether SDR or old-school) and all things microcontroller related.
- I mostly focus on ESP modules and the RP2040 these days but I've been known to dabble in other 
- ARM-based hardware (hacking on the HackRF firmware was especially fun)
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.  After 20+ of using Java, C++, and Perl I figured it's
- time to get hip to what all the kids are doing with this newfangled snake language ;)
- 
- I'm really enjoying the uPython environment.  It's ideal for small projects that require
- minimal computing horsepower but require a lot of I/O.
-
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... send me a message here, or you can find me on Reddit as u/ai6aj
